# This is the Recipe for Chocolate Cake


#Equipment

    Baking Tin
    Large bowl

###Ingredients
#Dry Ingredients

    2 Cups Sweet Rice Flour Or Thai Glutinous Rice Flour if on a budget.
    ¾ Cup Brown Sugar You can use white sugar if you don’t have brown but brown sugar will result in a more aromatic cake (and you can easily make brown sugar at home) If you have a very sweet tooth, you can increase the sugar to 1 Cup.
    1 teaspoon baking powder do NOT use baking soda instead

#Wet ingredients

    2 egg room temperature, beaten
    ½ Cup whole milk I have not experimented with semi-skimmed or plant-base milk (although I do have a vegan mochi muffin recipe!)
    5 Tablespoons butter melted. both salted butter and unsalted butter work- salt is a flavor enhancer so I usually use salted. However, some don’t like salt in their desserts, in which case use unsalted.
    14 oz coconut cream You can find 14-oz cans. not to be confused with the thinner coconut milk!
    ½ teaspoon vanilla extract if you omit this, you are basically making Baked Chinese Nian Gao, a popular Chinese New Year dessert. It’s still tasty but the vanilla makes it smell SOOOO much nicer!

#Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 350F/ 176C/ 157C fan.
    Whilst the oven is preheating, oil a baking tin. (Use neutral vegetable oil or melted butter for this- if using butter, this is IN ADDITION to the 5 Tablespoons of butter specified in the recipe.) I used a round one, but you can also use an 8-inch square tin. (If using a square and not round baking pan, lining with parchment paper will suffice- you can skip the oiling.)
    In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients- the sweet rice flour, sugar, and baking powder- well.
    Mix the melted butter, coconut cream, whole milk, vanilla extract, and beaten eggs together.
    Pour the wet ingredients from 2a into the dry ingredients/ mixing bowl from Step 1. Stir till well-mixed.

    Note: You don’t have to worry about overmixing here, as glutinous rice flour has NO gluten so it will not become tough.
    Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan.
    Bake for 55-60 minutes. The cake should have turned golden brown and should smell amazing.
    Remove from oven, using oven gloves, and allow to cool on a wire rack,
    Cut into equal-sized mochi bars and serve. Delicious served warm with sweet red bean and vanilla ice cream!

#Notes
The pieces along the edge of the tin taste best, as there are more crunchy edges!
