# Lean borscht (vegan)


## Ingredients

- **2 liters** of **water**
- **3-4 potatoes**
- **2 beets**, raw
- **1 onion**
- **200 g of sauerkraut** (with brine)
- **½ carrot**
- **½ bell pepper**
- **1-2 tbsp. honey**
- **2 tbsp. tomato paste (or purée)**
- **salt and pepper** to taste

## Instructions

1. **Boil the vegetables:**
   - Clean and cut the beets in half. Add to a pot with water and boil for 40 minutes until ready. After that, add half of the onion and continue boiling.
   - Cut 3-4 potatoes into cubes and half a carrot into strips. Add them to the pot with beets.

2. **Sauté the vegetables:**
   - Dice half of the bell pepper and the other half of the onion. Fry for 3-5 minutes with a small amount of vegetable oil.
   - Add 2 tbsp. of tomato paste and stew for another 2-3 minutes.

3. **Combine the vegetables:**
   - Fish out the boiled beets, let them cool, cut them arbitrarily and send back into the broth.
   - Add the sauteed vegetables to the broth.
  
4. **Refine the taste:**
   - When all the vegetables are cooked, add sauerkraut with 200 g of brine into the broth. Let boil for 2-3 minutes and add salt, pepper and 1-2 tbsp. of honey.

5. **Finish up:**
   - Turn off the heat and leave the finished borscht to infuse for 15-20 minutes.
   - Alternatively, place it in the oven at 180 degrees for the same time.
   - Optionally, put it in the fridge to serve it the next day. Grandma says it's richer that way! 

**Serving suggestion:**
   - Grill some bread to form crust, take a cleaned clove of garlic, and scratch the crust with the garlic. You can either rub just the edges for some fine aroma, or use all the top surface as a grating for rich garlic taste.
